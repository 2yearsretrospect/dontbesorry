Object/location-based quest JSON
New Rule: Arrays of objects are henceforth BANEROO'ED. just make objects holding object cuz they're simpler

			"display": "You enter the elder's home. He asks you for a reminder of your name.",

				"???"
			}
		}
		"onenter": {
			A command object describing what happens on subsequent entries.
		}
	}
